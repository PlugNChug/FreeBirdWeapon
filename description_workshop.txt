[h1]The Free Bird Shredder[/h1]
[h2]Version: {ModVersion}[/h2]

Source code https://github.com/PlugNChug/FreeBirdWeapon

Item added: The Free Bird Shredder
[list]
  [*] It plays the backing track of the solo part of [i]Free Bird[/i] by Lynyrd Skynyrd when held
  [*] The guitar solo overlays the backing track if you are using the weapon
  [*] It significantly increases your movement speed when held
  [*] Right click (or whatever your 'Interact' keybind is) to switch between a ranged weapon mode and a hamaxe mode!
  [*] Craft it with The Axe, 5 of any Lunar Fragment, Illegal Gun Parts, and 5 of any Bird critter (Birds, Blue Jays, Cardinals)
  [*] [i](It also resembles the Gibson Explorer, which was used when Lynyrd Skynyrd recorded the studio version on Free Bird)[/i]
[/list]

Make sure your music is turned up, since the weapon will play sounds that are linked to the music volume slider.
This mod should be multiplayer compatible! Other players will not hear the music that's playing on your end.

Note: This mod pre-loads large sound files (the backing and guitar solo tracks) upon entering the world. You may experience a small one-time lag spike at that time.

[h2]For Streamers/Creators[/h2]
This mod includes a configuration option to use a MIDI version of Free Bird instead of the real version. [i]Disabled by default.[/i]
