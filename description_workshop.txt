[h1]The Free Bird Shredder[/h1]
[h2]Version: {ModVersion}[/h2]

Source code: {ModHomepage}

Item added: The Free Bird Shredder
[list]
  [*] It plays the backing track of the solo part of [i]Free Bird[/i] by Lynyrd Skynyrd when held
  [*] The guitar solo overlays the backing track if you are using the weapon
  [*] It significantly increases your movement speed when held
  [*] Right click (or whatever your 'Interact' keybind is) to switch between a ranged weapon mode and a hamaxe mode!
  [*] In ranged weapon mode, it counts as a specialist ranged weapon for Shroomite Armor.
  [*] It cannot be reforged.
  [*] Craft it with The Axe, 5 of any Lunar Fragment, Illegal Gun Parts, and 5 of any Bird critter (Birds, Blue Jays, Cardinals)
  [*] The music, which lasts over 4 minutes each cycle, loops back into itself relatively seamlessly.
  [*] [i](It also resembles the Gibson Explorer, which was used when Lynyrd Skynyrd recorded the studio version on Free Bird)[/i]
[/list]

Make sure your music is turned up, since the weapon will play sounds that are linked to the music volume slider.
This mod should be multiplayer compatible! Other players will not hear the music that's playing on your end.

Note: This mod pre-loads large sound files (the backing and guitar solo tracks) upon entering the world. You may experience a small one-time lag spike at that time.

[h2]Customize Your Free Bird Experience[/h2]
Server-sided configuration options now included!
[list]
  [*] Early craft recipe mode: Alternate recipe that allows the weapon to be crafted in a fresh world
  [*] Damage scaling mode: Damage will start low but scales based on how many bosses are defeated. Works well with early craft recipe mode enabled
  [*] Custom damage mode: Allows you to set a custom damage value to the weapon
[/list]
